LuaGRUB
=======
A GRUB-like bootloader for ComputerCraft

Features:
  Select between multiple OSes on a single computer.
  OSes can reboot into another OS, if they support it.
  Uses no global variables.

Planned:
  Trick OSes into thinking they are in the root folder, so OSes with absolute paths will not require recoding.
  Support scrolling.
